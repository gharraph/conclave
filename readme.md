# Conclave
Conclave is a web forum application that the Columbus Ruby Brigade is crafting. It is released under the MIT license.

The project was started on 9/8/2012 and is under development. It is not recommended to use at this point.

This project will start as a Rails application, but once approaching release we'll repackage as a gem that will integrate into an existing Rails application.

## Goals
1. Teach the beauty of the Ruby and Rails stack
2. Lower the Open Source contribution barrier
4. Release useful, working software.

## How to contribute
All contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps for easy contributions:

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Implement your code changes
3. Test your changes -- I'm more concerned with testing the **intent** of your code, not it's **implementation**. If it's a smallish change, write a unit test or two. If it's a larger feature, we'll need a Cucumber scenario(s).
4. Submit a Pull Request on Github!
